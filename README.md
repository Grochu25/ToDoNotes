# ToDoNotes
This is an Android application created to complete a university course. It was developed by a group of three, where @kicerKs was responsible for the database, @JakubD02 was responsible for views and I was responsible for model and viewmodels.

Application is a simple manager for ToDo notes. It allows to:
- create new notes with one of three importance levels in specified category
- edit and remove existing notes
- edit, add and remove categories
- filter notes by categories
- sort by note title or date
- search for notes by keywords
In addition each note has date and time of reminder notification set while creation, and the application includes a widget displaying the most important notes
